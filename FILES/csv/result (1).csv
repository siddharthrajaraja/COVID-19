"This clinic is being established as a testing site for patients who have already been prescreened by their health care providers.

The clinic is for adults ages 18 and older who have a referral or order from their health care providers and have exhibited a broad range of upper respiratory illnesses, including influenza, sore throat, strep throat, fevers or potential exposure to COVID-19.

Patients will only be tested for COVID-19 if testing is indicated by their clinic medical exam. Not all patients will be tested for COVID-19.

Patients who come to the fever clinic will call 256-773-6017 and wait in their car upon arrival. Preliminary registration information will be collected while the patient remains in the car.

The patient will be evaluated and possibly tested in their car.

Please bring your photo ID, insurance card and cellphone if you have one.

The clinic visit will be billed to your health insurance. No money will be collected on site.

Any person with a medical emergency such as shortness of breath or respiratory distress should call 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.","","<p style=""color: #717C8E;font-size:13px"" class="""">

"Monroe County Hospital is committed to protecting our community, patients, and staff from COVID-19. As part of this commitment, we have performed 20 tests on qualifying individuals who met CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and ADPH (Alabama Department of Public Health) testing guidelines. We have not had any positive results. Due to high volume, there is a delayed turn around for test results.

ADPH announced a major change in testing criteria based on federal guidelines to ensure those who are more at risk receive testing. Previously, testing was based on the clinical judgment of the ordering provider, however, the new guidance states that the only tests to be run by the state lab are ones in which:
%u2022 The patient is symptomatic with at minimum (measured or subjective fever OR cough OR shortness of breath, and
%u2022 The patient is hospitalized, or
%u2022 The patient is immunocompromised or has co- morbidities, or
%u2022 The patient age 65 years or older, or
%u2022 The patient is a healthcare worker, or
%u2022 The patient is associated with a long-term healthcare facility

Individuals with no symptoms or mild symptoms should not be tested. Please do your part to protect our community by social distancing, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. %u201CThe most important infection prevention measure against coronavirus is proper hand washing and cough etiquette (covering mouth with a tissue and/or coughing into sleeve/elbow),%u201D said Jessica Goodson, RN, BSN, MCH Infection Preventionist.","","<p style=""font-size:14px"" class=""dont-break-out"">

                                This clinic is being established as a testing site for patients who have already been prescreened by their health care providers.

The clinic is for adults ages 18 and older who have a referral or order from their health care providers and have exhibited a broad range of upper respiratory illnesses, including influenza, sore throat, strep throat, fevers or potential exposure to COVID-19.

Patients will only be tested for COVID-19 if testing is indicated by their clinic medical exam. Not all patients will be tested for COVID-19.

Patients who come to the fever clinic will call 256-773-6017 and wait in their car upon arrival. Preliminary registration information will be collected while the patient remains in the car.

The patient will be evaluated and possibly tested in their car.

Please bring your photo ID, insurance card and cellphone if you have one.

The clinic visit will be billed to your health insurance. No money will be collected on site.

Any person with a medical emergency such as shortness of breath or respiratory distress should call 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.

We have a triage station at our entrance that will direct you to the appropriate place. We have also temporarily changed our hours to 7am-7pm for both outside and inside service.

"Urgent Care for Children is now offering to perform curbside COVID-19 testing for high-risk patients (0-21 years old), which will be sent to a third-party lab and results typically return within 24 to 72 hours. We strongly recommend that patients complete a telemedicine screening before being tested for COVID-19 to reduce exposure.

                                Monroe County Hospital is committed to protecting our community, patients, and staff from COVID-19. As part of this commitment, we have performed 20 tests on qualifying individuals who met CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and ADPH (Alabama Department of Public Health) testing guidelines. We have not had any positive results. Due to high volume, there is a delayed turn around for test results.

ADPH announced a major change in testing criteria based on federal guidelines to ensure those who are more at risk receive testing. Previously, testing was based on the clinical judgment of the ordering provider, however, the new guidance states that the only tests to be run by the state lab are ones in which:
%u2022 The patient is symptomatic with at minimum (measured or subjective fever OR cough OR shortness of breath, and
%u2022 The patient is hospitalized, or
%u2022 The patient is immunocompromised or has co- morbidities, or
%u2022 The patient age 65 years or older, or
%u2022 The patient is a healthcare worker, or
%u2022 The patient is associated with a long-term healthcare facility

Individuals with no symptoms or mild symptoms should not be tested. Please do your part to protect our community by social distancing, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. %u201CThe most important infection prevention measure against coronavirus is proper hand washing and cough etiquette (covering mouth with a tissue and/or coughing into sleeve/elbow),%u201D said Jessica Goodson, RN, BSN, MCH Infection Preventionist.
